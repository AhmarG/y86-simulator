y86 simulator
==========
This repository contains all of the files necessary to create a program that simulates a pipelined microarchitecture. The machine consists of three components: memory, program registers, and processor registers. The simulated primary memory is organized as 1024 four-byte words. The processor registers are the F, D, E, M and W registers. They are represented as structs in the files fetchStage.h, decodeStage.h, executeStage.h, memoryStage.h and writebackStage.h. The machine can simulate the execution of nop, halt, dump, irmovl, addl, andl, xorl, subl, cmovXX/rrmovl, rmmovl, mrmovl, pushl, popl, call, ret, and jXX instructions.
